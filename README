Tools to bridge GURPS tooling and provide automation.

GCS Constraints
---------------

1.  GCS has no API, must poll/watch file for changes.

MapTool constraints
-------------------

1.  MapTool can only make blocking HTTP GET requests
    that lock up the interface while ongoing.
2.  MapTool 1.8 can have UI elements make requests to run Macros,
    and macros may execute code in UI elements, so requests are possible.
3.  MapTool script is unwieldy and JavaScript is better, but still not nice,
    so code in it should be kept to a minimum.
4.  Notifications of changes can only happen from other clients,
    so actions must be driven by the UI and broadcast to the connected user
    who owns the character sheet.

Design constraints
------------------

Must be cross platform,
so cross-compile to Windows with mingw-w64,
and use a web UI.

Do we either:
1.  Export a HTTP API for use by both MapTool and the UI, or
2.  Implement a MapTool client that can synchronise


GCS file update:
